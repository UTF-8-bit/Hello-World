// String
// There are three types of strings in Javascript
// 'Single qoutes', "Double qoutes", and `Backticks`.

//const  singleQoutes = 'Hello!';
//const doubleQoutes = "Hello!!";
// Single qoutes and double qoutes are the exact samething in Javascript.
// These two strings are called simple strings not complex strings.
// You can input any text value into the variable.
const DBname = "Hari";
const backticks = `Hello, ${DBname} Welcome!`;
// Backticks are called complex strings
// Use backticks only when you need an extended functionality. 
// You can embed/combine variables and expressions in strings, with backticks.
// How? By wrapping the defined var/exp inside the backticks in dollar signs then curly braces.
console.log(backticks);
