// If you put in (typeof null) the screen prints object. It is a bug that Javascript left that kinda works and makes the new datatype object.
// It's used to assign unknown values to it. 
/* Null can be, example when a user 
types in their age you reassign 
the value of the variable from null to 20*/

// Javascript never does null you have to declare it, Undefined is already there in javascript. 
// Undefined means the variable has been declared but not yet been assigned a value.
