There are 6 types of data 
Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null, Undefined, Object, and Symbol.   

Strings are text in qoutation marks "" like sentences and paragraphs.
Booleans contain two values, True or false.
Null is a value we have to store in, but it is simply non-existent.
Undefined means we don't have the variable or the value, it doesn't exist.
Symbols are rarely used for data types.
Object is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for Javascript.
